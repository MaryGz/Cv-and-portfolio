# Hi, I'm María Gutiérrez 👋
### Documentation Engineer | DX Specialist | Visual Technical Communicator

I am a Software Engineer turned Technical Writer with 4+ years of experience bridging the gap between complex codebases and developer productivity. I specialize in Docs-as-Code, compliance automation, and visual knowledge architecture. Currently working @ Oracle.

## 🚀 From Dev to Technical Writer
There are few things as frustrating and unhelpful to a software dev than incomplete, confusing, or non-existing documentation. I discovered that **this is a problem that enjoy solving.** 
My background as a Java/Python developer allows me to understand the "how" of software, while my passion for synthesis and visual design allows me to master the "why" and the "what." Also my experience trying to workl with decade-old documentation allows me to empathize with current developers. 

- **Technical Roots:** 4+ years at Oracle & Texas Instruments.
- **Visual Strategy:** Graduate Diploma in Graphics & Animation applied to technical diagrams.
- **Efficiency First:** Proven track record of reducing manual compliance tasks by 95%+.

2. Simplify complex distributed systems architecture.
3. **Are easy and comfortable to read.**
