# Hi, I'm María Gutiérrez 👋
### Documentation Engineer | DX Specialist | Visual Technical Communicator

I am a **Software Engineer** turned **Technical Writer** with 4+ years of experience (ex-Oracle) bridging the gap between complex codebases and developer productivity. I specialize in **Docs-as-Code**, compliance automation, and visual knowledge architecture.

## 🚀 The Intersection of Engineering & Clarity
My background as a Java/Python developer allows me to understand the "how" of software, while my passion for synthesis and visual design allows me to master the "why" and the "what."

- **Technical Roots:** 4+ years at Oracle & Texas Instruments.
- **Visual Strategy:** Graduate Diploma in Graphics & Animation applied to technical diagrams.
- **Efficiency First:** Proven track record of reducing manual compliance tasks by 95%+.

## 🌟 Featured Expertise: "The Visual Edge"
Unlike traditional technical writers, I leverage my **Graphics & Animation diploma** to eliminate cognitive load. I don't just write manuals; I design **visual learning experiences** that:
1. Reduce "Time-to-First-Commit" for new developers.
2. Simplify complex distributed systems architecture.
3. Standardize global localization (L10N) through visual style guides.
